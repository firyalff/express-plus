# express-plus

Powered up express.js using several node modules such as sequelize, lusca, express-ejs-layout, etc.

Use custom routing system that utilize JSON for routes, minimizing size of code compared to standard express.js routing (Which happily reduce a bit of memory usage since javascript caching in require() put codes into memory).

Routing using JSON supports group prefix, group middlewares (thanks to laravel for being inspiration).

Mostly utilizing ES2015 as writing standard (and promises)
